# Common mistakes developers make starting their first SaaS

Last month I gave a talk at the Ruby conference Friendly.rb about starting your own SaaS. I couldn't fit my talk in the 25 minute slot and had to delete 17 slides. I will resurrect some of those slides and fit them into this article.

## Before building a SaaS, I should build an audience first

## Nobody is going to pay for that, I can build this in a weekend

## We should do Freemium, nobody is going to sign up with a credit card

## A good product will sell itself

## Pretending that you are a big company

## Treating your customers the way you want to be treated

## We have to do everything legal, GDPR, etc

## Bad ideas for a SaaS bootstrapper

### Two-sided market places

### Ideas that are too big

### Targeting Consumers

### Ideas that don't fit a category

### Ideas that lead to changing behavior.

### Ideas for people without money.

## Good ideas

- Solve a painful problem
- For a reachable group of people with a big budget (niche)
- With an existing category (helps with explanation, SEO, and Integration marketing)
- Ideally with some existing competitors but not too many
